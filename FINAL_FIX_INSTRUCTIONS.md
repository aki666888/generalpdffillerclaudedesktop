# Final Fix Instructions - Path and Field Name

## Two Issues Found:

1. **Wrong Path**: Filler looks in `C:\forms\` but files are in `C:\mcp-servers\pharmacare-form\`
2. **Wrong Field Name**: JSON has "Patient Symptoms and Signs" but should be "symptoms"

## Simple Fix:

### Step 1: Copy the fixed filler
```bash
copy enhanced_pdf_filler_v2_correct_path.py C:\mcp-servers\pharmacare-form\enhanced_pdf_filler_v2.py
```

This filler:
- Looks for mapping in `C:\mcp-servers\pharmacare-form\` FIRST
- Looks for field named "symptoms" (not "Patient Symptoms and Signs")

### Step 2: Copy the fixed mapping
```bash
copy macs_form_mapping_v3_fixed.json C:\mcp-servers\pharmacare-form\macs_form_mapping_v3.json
```

This mapping:
- Has field named "symptoms" instead of "Patient Symptoms and Signs"

### Step 3: Restart JSON-RPC server
```bash
cd C:\mcp-servers\pharmacare-form
python json_rpc_server.py
```

## Why This Works:

1. **Path is correct**: Filler looks in `C:\mcp-servers\pharmacare-form\` first
2. **Field names match**: Both use "symptoms"
3. **PDF location**: Filler looks for blank.pdf in same folder as mapping

## Test:
The symptoms should now appear because:
- Claude sends: `"symptoms": "text"`
- JSON file has: `"symptoms": [coordinates]`
- Filler looks for: `field_type == 'symptoms'`
- All match! âœ“
